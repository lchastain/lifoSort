The uppercase of this file name has the effect of disabling the code autocompletion and suggestions as you type.
Not sure why that is, since the .log extension already does not have an associated file type, but you do get
the annoyances when the filename and extension are in lowercase.

No longer sure that the answer here is recursion.  New idea about the approach is to take the initial tableau and make
a list of every possible single move from that point.  Then begin cycling thru those moves and after each one, snapshot
the tableau and make a new list of possibilities, to be added to the worklist.  Eventually we will either have found a
solution, or exhausted all possibilities.  The 'master list' will be a pair of 1: a tableau and 2: a list of possible
moves from that point.
----
Enabled git for this project, to commit and preserve the initial approach that took in some user input for user
specification of problem size.  Now that info is built in to the construction of the first tableau.
----
Continuing with finding all moves, how to avoid circular possibilities?  Need to review that master list each time
a move is considered, to ensure that the new tableau would not be a repetition of one that is already in the list.  This
means that tableaus should not be removed from the main list just because all their possibilities have been exhausted.
Current thought is that the shortest path would always be the one you arrived at first; need to verify that.  But if
not then when considering adding one you just take the one that has a shorter path to get there, vs just keeping the
one that is already there.
----
Ok, so this might be recursion after all; when a TubeRack construction goes off to list its possibilities and then
constructs more TubeRacks to cover those possibilities, that would be recursion.

Changed from Integer colors to actual named enums.  This will make it easier to initialize in the future, without
the need to change integer values for every new puzzle, and printouts will not need translation from a number to a
color.  Major effect on all arrays, lists, etc.  Had to go from type <E> to type <ItemColor>.
-------
Made the adjustments needed to be able to get all the way through a first trial.  Now looking at how to set up and
initiate a second trial.  Haven't yet encountered/had to handle a second-level (or deeper) reset within a trial.

Began the process of making a 'move', evaluating the result, and going to the next step after that.  Loops at this
stage are simplistic and fail quickly; need to refine so that a trial can get all the way to the 'end' and then
begin recursion in order to go on to the next trial.

Did the LIFO as a new TestTube class, worked on getting the initial setup into the app, and showing the contents of
each tube.

30 July 2021 - A new Java project; an app to solve the iPad 'Ball Sort Puzzle' game.
Initial vision is to use a set of LIFO stacks and a brute-force approach.
Cleared up the 'no package' warning by setting the containing folder as 'sources' via module settings.
Upgraded my Java to 16.0.2.
Next:  Implement a LIFO, and more -
